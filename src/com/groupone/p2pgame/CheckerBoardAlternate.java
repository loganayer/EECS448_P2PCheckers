/**
   CheckerBoardAlternate is the main entry point into the checkers
   board. It creates the grid that is filled with all 64 spaces and
   the 24 pieces.

   The checkers board consists of 32 black spaces and 32 red spaces.
   Only the 32 black spaces will have pieces on them.

   This keeps track of the "active player", that is who's turn it is
   to move. It stops the other pieces from moving when they are not
   one of the active player's pieces. As of now, there is no obvious
   way to know who's turn it is without trial and error.

   Each time an active piece is clicked, the possible moves are
   highilighted. Clicking on one of the highlighted spaces causes the
   player's turn to end, and for the next player's turn to begin,
   unless there is another "double jump" that can be made. In those
   cases, the checker board enters "extra jump mode".

   In extra jump mode, all other movement is frozen except for the
   highlighted extraa jump. In this version of checkers, you cannot
   skip the extra jump. The game will proceed only after you have
   chosen to take extra jumps until you can do so no more. This
   mechanism is to prevent the user from sneaking in another unrelated
   move and passing it off as an "extra jump".
